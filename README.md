# About-Planets
This is a webpage that is dedicated to describing our solar system. 

It is split into 4 sections which are
- Welcome
- About planets
- Orbits
- Future Missions

This project is to practise new skills that I have learnt from FreeCodeCamps Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Courses.
